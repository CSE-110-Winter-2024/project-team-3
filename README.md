# Team 3 - Successorator 

Successorator is an Android app that will allow the user to keep track of their goals on a current day that automatically roll over between successsive days.

# Documentation
Iteration 1:
Total hours = 30 hours
We have five people in our group, each can contribute 6 hours to the project
Hours work done = 22.5 hours
For the first iteration, we spent most of the time developing the database for the goals, setting up functionionalities of recurring goals, and adding focus features to the goals. We were able to get a lot done for this iteration because we decided to spend 3 hours after each class to meet up and worked on the project. We spent less time online and more time in person to code. Doing this made the team more productive.

Estimation of the Velocity: 
Velocity = Hours work done / Total hours = 22.5/30 = 0.75

Iteration 2:
Total hours = .3

Hours work done = 25 hours
We estimated that we will be able keep up with iteration's 1 velocity and get as much productivity from the team as possible by meeting in person and designate clear task for everyone to complete. This time, we were able to get the app finished few days before deadline. We also spent more hours doing manual testings and refinements to our code.

Estimation of the Velocity: 
Using the velocity that weâ€™ve gained from iteration 1:
Velocity = Hours work done / Total hours = 22.5/30 = 0.75
Total hours = Hours work done / Velocity = 25/0.6 = 33.333 hours

With our current velocity and estimated work done for all of the tasks, it will take us roughly 33.3 total hours to complete the remaining user stories.
